# Things you can do!

- replace all BigInt with GMP signed integer arithmetic ("gmp numbers") in `group_exchange.rs` and `ssh.rs`. Quoth the manual:

```
  1. Functions for signed integer arithmetic, with names beginning with
     `mpz_'.  The associated type is `mpz_t'.  There are about 150
     functions in this class.  (*note Integer Functions::)
```

- [use the gmp](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation#C)
